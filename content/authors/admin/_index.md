I am a first-year PhD student in the Statistics program at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. I come from Mpraeso, a beautiful small town in the Okwahu plains in the eastern region of Ghana. I obtained my MS degree in Statistics & Data Science at the University of Nevada, Reno. Before that, I received my BS in Actuarial Science from Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology.   

I am open to vast research areas but currently exploring the fields of Statistical Machine Learning, Computational Statistics, Probabilistic Graphical Models and Bayesian Analysis, with applications in public health.

When I have some time to spare, I enjoy listening to music, spending time with my friends and family and watching soccer (I'm a staunch fan of Manchester United).
