I am a 5th-year PhD candidate in the [Statistics program](https://lsa.umich.edu/stats) at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. I come from [Mpraeso](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mpraeso), a beautiful small town in the Okwahu plains in the eastern region of Ghana. I obtained my MS degree in [Statistics & Data Science](https://www.unr.edu/math) at the University of Nevada, Reno. Before that, I received my BS in Actuarial Science from [Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology](https://www.knust.edu.gh/).   

I am working under the supervision of [Professor Kerby Shedden](https://lsa.umich.edu/stats/people/faculty/kshedden.html), currently focusing on using flexible, non-parametric methods to study the full conditional distribution of a response variable, especially in complex and high-dimensional data scenarios.

When I have some time to spare, I enjoy listening to music, spending time with my friends and family and watching soccer (I'm a staunch fan of Manchester United).

My work has found applications in advancing healthcare through statistical methodology and machine learning, with contributions to precision medicine in cancer research, cardiovascular health, anthropometry, and public health. More recently, I have been collaborating with the [AEDI](https://aedi.ssw.umich.edu/) on projects related to asset development, education, and financial inclusion. This work focuses on creating opportunities for low-income children and families in the U.S. and worldwide, helping to break cycles of poverty and foster upward economic mobility.
